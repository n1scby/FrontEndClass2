                <h2>Article One</h2>
                <p>
                    Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training.
                    Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? I will obey your
                    orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die
                    with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Talk about going nowhere fast.
                    This should be interesting. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'?
                    Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! We could cause a diplomatic crisis.
                </p>

                <h2>Article 2</h2>
                <p>
                    Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. In all trust,
                    there is the possibility for betrayal. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin
                    joint like this? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? I'd like to think that I haven't changed those
                    things, sir. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human
                    loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Mr. Crusher,
                    ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I'll be sure to note that in my log.
                </p>
